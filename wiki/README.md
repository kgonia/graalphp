# Wiki: WordPress on GraalVM (Truffle PHP)

**Goal:** GraalVM makes PHP code itself faster. WordPress and its plugins run unmodified on a PHP implementation written as a Truffle language, and beat PHP 8.4 with OPcache JIT. See [decisions.md](decisions.md), D1.

## Status

| Gate | State |
|---|---|
| Gate 0: Amdahl ceiling of WordPress on php-fpm | not started (can run in parallel with Gate 1) |
| **Gate 1: Truffle core vs PHP 8.5 JIT on extracted WordPress hot functions** | **in progress: all 7 kernels correct; performance at 0.59× of PHP end to end (from 0.24×); engine micro-benchmarks up to 12× faster than PHP** |
| Gate 2: WordPress boots and renders | — |
| Gate 3: drop-in parity | — |
| Gate 4: performance and publication | — |

## Key numbers (2026-10-22)
- **WordPress core:** 625k lines of PHP, calling **677 distinct built-ins** (about 570 needed, since `sodium_*` has a PHP polyfill) in 31.8k call sites.
- **php-src:** about 700k lines of its own C (1.86M with bundled libraries and the generated VM), 1,923 built-in functions and 23,640 `.phpt` tests.
- **Estimated Truffle PHP for WordPress and the top plugins:** 150–250k lines of Java; Gate 1 needs about 15–25k.
